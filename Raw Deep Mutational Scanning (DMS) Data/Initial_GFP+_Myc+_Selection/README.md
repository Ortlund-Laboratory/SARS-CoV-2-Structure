# Workflow to Calculate Initial Expression of Variants

SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid variant stability according to initial GFP<sup>+</sup>Myc<sup>+</sup> selection was investigated, with GFP<sup>+</sup> and GFP<sup>+</sup>Myc<sup>+</sup> populations collected for sequencing. These sequences can be processed to give scores indicating level of expression.
